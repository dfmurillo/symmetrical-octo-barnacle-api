# Andrew Alliance Test
Hello fellow interviewers, first of all, thank you for your time and I hope you enjoy my test.

To have a quick start I cloned the Microsoft Node/Typescript repo `microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter` (well, finally we need to thank them because of Typescript, also the old IE8 and Windows Vista are in the past).

My intention with this readme is to tell my journey creating the project, what I learned, what surprised me and make this boring code test more enjoyable.

Something before the start, I try to stay KISS, building only the functionality I need, after some time there will be time to improve code, but for now... time is gold.

I Started by cleaning a little bit the repo, deleting some files, also dependencies that I´m not using right now, maybe later, but we´ll see. 

After the cleaning, I was eager to continue, so I created the PR and sqash-merged the code, but, I forgot to run the server and check that was up and running. I know, beginner's error, but no worries, we can fix it!

Well, here we are, coding, so far I have added some basic routes, also improved the structure of the project by implementing more typings, trying to stay simple as possible, but, adding some fancy code. After all, I want to impress you and show you more of what I´m capable of.
